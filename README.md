# jaNET Framework
A free and open source IoT framework that provides multiple functions and native API that allow 3rd party software (e.g. jubito.org) to utilize, in order to interact with multiple vendor hardware (especially open hardware, e.g. Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Banana Pi, etc). It is designed to be absolutely vendor-neutral as well as hardware/protocol-agnostic and can run on any device that is capable of running .NET Framework or mono-runtime (Linux, Windows, Mac).
