# jaNET Framework
An open source IoT framework that provides multiple functions and an API that a 3rd party software (e.g. jubito.org) can use in order to interact with multiple vendor hardware (especially open hardware, e.g. Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Banana Pi, etc). It is designed to be absolutely vendor-neutral as well as hardware/protocol-agnostic and can run on any device that is capable of running .NET Framework or mono-runtime (Linux, Windows, Mac).
